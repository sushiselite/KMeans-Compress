## Introduction

K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that can be applied to various domains, including image processing. This notebook demonstrates how K-Means clustering can be utilized to compress an image by reducing the number of distinct colors in the image.

The notebook covers the following main steps:
1. Loading the input image
2. Preprocessing the image
3. Applying K-Means clustering
4. Reducing the color palette
5. Reconstructing the compressed image
6. Evaluating the compression ratio

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```shell
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```
## Usage

1. Clone this repository
